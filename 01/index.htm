			<h4>Taylor Swift</h4>
	We were both young when I first saw you</br>
	I close my eyes and the flashback starts</br>
	I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air</br>
	See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns</br>
	See you make your way through the crowd</br>
	And say hello, little did I know</br>
	That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles</br>
	And my daddy said stay away from Juliet</br>
	And I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go</br>
	And I said</br>
	Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone</br>
	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run</br>
	You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess</br>
	It's a love story</br>
	Baby, just say yes</br>
	So I sneak out to the garden to see you</br>
	We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew</br>
	So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while</br>
	Oh, oh, oh</br>
	'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter</br>
	And my daddy said stay away from Juliet</br>
	But you were everything to me, I was begging you please don't go</br>
	And I said</br>
	Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone</br>
	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run</br>
	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess</br>
	It's a love story</br>
	Baby, just say yes</br>
